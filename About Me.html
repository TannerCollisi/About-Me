    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I go to Greencastle High School and am currently attending Area30. I also plan on going to college after high school in 2021, more specifically Depauw University.
      <br>I’m interested in learning more about computer science and thought about getting into the entertainment industry. In my free time I like to play video games such as DOOM, Dead by Daylight, and TF2. And in my freetime I model 3D art and even make games!

      <li>
        <h4>3D Art</h4>
      </li>
        <ul>
          When I was little I used to love legos, always building something new, but was limited by only having a few blocks. But now with 3D software it’s like I’m a kid again without the limitations!

        <h4>Early 2000’s Stuff</h4>
      </li>
        <ul>
          I enjoyed a lot of the early cartoons that would air on Cartoon Network
        </ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Video Games</h4>
      </li>
        <ul>
          I enjoy games that are super fast pace and engaging, like DOOM. And I like games that are relaxing and let me be creative, Like Minecraft.
        </ul>
    </ol>
